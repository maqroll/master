Networks and clocks are unreliable.
Distributed systems -> partial failures are possible!!
Circuit switching (allocated bandwidth) vs packet switching (queueing).
Byzantine fault tolerant.
Synchronous model (bounded network delay, bounded process pauses & bounded clock error).
Partially synchronous model (synchronous model most of the time).
Asynchronous model (no assumptions are possible).
